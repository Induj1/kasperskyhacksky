                    KIPS is a strategic business simulation, a team game that demonstrates the connection between business efficiency and cybersecurity. 
                    Game-based learning helps to engage decision-makers in cybersecurity and motivate them to take further steps in building 
                    a cybersafe corporate environment.

                  <p className="text-gray-300">
                    KIPS is an exercise that places business decision makers as members of IT security teams into a simulated business environment 
                    facing a series of unexpected cyberthreats where their main goal is to keep company working and get revenue. The idea is to 
                    build a cyber defense strategy by making choices from amongst the best pro-active and re-active controls available.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p className="text-gray-300">
                    Every reaction made by the teams to the unfolding events changes the way the scenario plays out, and ultimately how much 
                    profit the company makes or fails to make.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p className="text-gray-300">
                    Balancing engineering, business, and security priorities against the cost of a realistic cyberattack, the teams analyze 
                    data and make strategic decisions based on uncertain information and limited resources. If that sounds realistic, it should do, 
                    because each of the scenarios is based on real-life events.
